  <h2>Senators move to pass PH maritime zones law to stop China’s bullying.</h2>
  <p>Senators are seeking an end to China’s continued bullying with the passage of the proposed Philippine maritime zones law. Senate Bill  No. 2492 was elevated to the Senate floor on Tuesday by the chamber’s special committee on Philippine maritime and admiralty zones through its chairman, Senator Francis Tolentino. Nine senators authored the measure, namely Tolentino, Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr., JV Ejercito, Jinggoy Estrada, Risa Hontiveros, Loren Legarda, Joel Villanueva, Sherwin Gatchalian, Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa, and Raffy Tulfo.</p>

  <h2>October's budget deficit for the Philippines shrank due to an enormous spike in revenue.</h2>
  <p>The government’s budget deficit was markedly smaller in October than a year ago after growth in revenue collections outpaced that of state spending during the month. Treasury data released Wednesday showed the budget gap shrank 65.27 percent year-on-year to P34.4 billion in October from P99 billion a year ago. This was also significantly narrower than the P250.9 billion gap last September. That the government’s budget balance remained in deficit means the state continued to spend beyond its means. To bridge the budget gap, the state had to borrow from creditors at home and abroad.</p>
